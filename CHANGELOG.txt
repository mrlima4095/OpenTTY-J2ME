- assets/python/remote.py - remote shell to opentty

[ Notes ]

- To set server response nanoContent, to save it into a file in another device use command `set RESPONSE nano`
- If nano doesnt open, try use rnano to clean content, if you load a bytecode or a too large file it wont open
- Port scanner may had your performance damaged by running device, it doest use an external API, used a internal method to run port dump
- You can see Silvio Santos article in portuguese if your locale is setted to 'pt-BR'
