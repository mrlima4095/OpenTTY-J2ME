# 🔒 OpenTTY Security

This document describes the security practices, known risks, and guidelines for contributing to security improvements in the OpenTTY-J2ME project.

## 🛡️ Security Practices

* **⚙️ Restricted Execution Environment:** OpenTTY is designed to run on limited-resource devices like old mobile phones. It should be considered a trusted terminal, not a tool to access critical systems.

* **🔑 Password Storage:** The user password is saved within an inaccessible file.

* **🌐 No Communication Encryption:** OpenTTY does not implement encryption for network communication. Using secure networks or a VPN is recommended to protect transmitted data.

## ⚠️ Known Risks

* **💻 Sandbox Execution:** OpenTTY runs on the JVM, so it cannot execute arbitrary system commands directly on the device. However, vulnerabilities could still exist within the JVM or the app itself.

* **🚫 Lack of Access Control:** There is no granular access control. Anyone with access to the device can use the terminal.

* **📱 Device Security Dependency:** The security of the application depends on the underlying device’s security features, which may vary between models and manufacturers.

## 📝 Contributing to Security Improvements

Contributions to enhance OpenTTY security are welcome. When contributing, consider the following:

* **🔍 Code Review:** Submit pull requests addressing potential vulnerabilities or improving overall application security.

* **🧪 Security Testing:** Conduct static and dynamic security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

* **📚 Security Documentation:** Update documentation to reflect changes that could affect security, including new dependencies or altered application behavior.
